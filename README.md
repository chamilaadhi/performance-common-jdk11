This repository has common artifacts to be used for Performance Tests.

In [components](components), there are several Java projects and each project builds an executable JAR file.

The [distribution](distribution) directory has the scripts and the Maven project to build the final distribution package
 including all scripts and components to be used for performance tests.

The package (**performance-common-distribution-${version}.tar.gz**) built by the distribution maven module can be used as a dependency to write
performance testing scripts.

This package only provides helper scripts and applications. You must extend the functionality of these scripts to run performance tests.

It's recommended to include the contents of this package with any scripts written to extend the functionality.

## Package contents

Following is the tree view of the contents inside distribution package.

```console

10 directories, 26 files
```

Each directory has one or more executable scripts. All scripts support `-h` (help) option.

**Note:** Most of these scripts will work only on Debian based systems like Ubuntu.

See following sections for more details.

### AWS CloudFormation

The performance test scripts can create AWS resources to run standard server performance tests on AWS.

Standard server performance tests include a Back-end service and the parameters include "Application heap memory sizes",
"Concurrent users", "Message sizes", and "Back-end Sleep Times".

The `create-template.py` script can create AWS CloudFormation template based on a `Jinja2` template. The `common_perf_test_cfn.yaml` file
is a common `Jinja2` template, which has necessary configurations to create a performance test environment on AWS.

You should extend `cloudformation-common.sh` to run standard server performance tests. By extending, you can will get all the functionality
of creating the AWS stack, run the tests, delete stack and summarize results. You can even run several stacks to run performance tests parallely.

The `cloudformation-common.sh` script is not directly executable, but it supports following options.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./cloudformation/cloudformation-common.sh -h

Usage: 
./cloudformation/cloudformation-common.sh -f <performance_scripts_distribution> [-d <results_dir>] -k <key_file> -n <key_name>
   -j <jmeter_distribution> -o <oracle_jdk_distribution> -g <gcviewer_jar_path>
   -s <stack_name_prefix> -b <s3_bucket_name> -r <s3_bucket_region>
   -J <jmeter_client_ec2_instance_type> -S <jmeter_server_ec2_instance_type>
   -N <netty_ec2_instance_type> 
   [-t <number_of_stacks>] [-p <parallel_parameter_option>] [-w <minimum_stack_creation_wait_time>]
   [-h] -- [run_performance_tests_options]

-f: Distribution containing the scripts to run performance tests.
-d: The results directory. Default value is a directory with current time. For example, results-20190124094422.
-k: Amazon EC2 Key File. Amazon EC2 Key Name must match with this file name.
-n: Amazon EC2 Key Name.
-j: Apache JMeter (tgz) distribution.
-o: Oracle JDK distribution.
-g: Path of GCViewer Jar file, which will be used to analyze GC logs.
-s: The Amazon CloudFormation Stack Name Prefix.
-b: Amazon S3 Bucket Name.
-r: Amazon S3 Bucket Region.
-J: Amazon EC2 Instance Type for JMeter Client.
-S: Amazon EC2 Instance Type for JMeter Server.
-N: Amazon EC2 Instance Type for Netty (Back-end) Service.
-t: Number of stacks to create. Default: 1.
-p: Parameter option of the test script, which will be used to run tests in parallel.
    Default: u. Allowed option characters: ubsm.
-w: The minimum time to wait in minutes before polling for cloudformation stack's CREATE_COMPLETE status.
    Default: 5.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

When running the performance tests, you can use `get-wum-updated-wso2-product.sh` script to get a WSO2 product with all WUM updates.

### Java

Use the `install-java.sh` script to install Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) on 64bit Linux.

The `install-java.sh` script in this directory will not be useful when OpenJDK is used. It's recommended to use the default package
repositories to install OpenJDK.

Currently `install-java.sh` script supports installing Oracle JDK 8.

You must download latest [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

This script can also install Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files. You need to
 copy JCE Policy zip file to the same location as the downloaded JDK file (tar.gz)

The script needs to be run as root. The JDK will be extracted to `/usr/lib/jvm` directory.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./java/install-java.sh -h

Usage: 
./java/install-java.sh -f <java_dist> [-p <java_dir>] [-u <user>] [-h]

-f: The jdk tar.gz file.
-p: Java installation directory.
-u: Target user. Default: ubuntu.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

### JMeter

#### Installing JMeter

The `install-jmeter.sh` script will extract JMeter, install Plugin Manager and copy the `user.properties` file.

The `user.properties` file has recommended configurations for performance tests.

There is an option to download latest [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jmeter/install-jmeter.sh -h

Usage: 
./jmeter/install-jmeter.sh -i <installation_dir> [-f <jmeter_dist>] [-d] [-p <jmeter_plugin_name>] [-h]

-i: Apache JMeter installation directory.
-f: Apache JMeter tgz distribution.
-d: Download Apache JMeter from web.
-p: The name of the JMeter Plugin to install. You can provide multiple names.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

#### Running standard server performance tests.

You shoud extend `perf-test-common.sh` to run standard server performance tests. It supports testing with multiple concurrent
users, different message sizes, different Back-end service delays and different heap memory sizes of the target server.

The script also supports running remote (distributed) JMeter tests and it will also summarize the results for warmup and
measurement periods.

A script can extend this `perf-test-common.sh` script by simply sourcing the `perf-test-common.sh` script.

For example:

```bash
# Execute common script
. $script_dir/perf-test-common.sh
```

Any script depending on this script must define test scenarios as follows:

```bash
declare -A test_scenario0=(
    [name]="test_scenario_name1"
    [display_name]="Test Scenario 1"
    [description]="Description of Test Scenario 1"
    [jmx]="test_scenario_name1.jmx"
    [use_backend]=true
    [skip]=false
)
declare -A test_scenario1=(
    [name]="test_scenario_name2"
    [display_name]="Test Scenario 2"
    [description]="Description of Test Scenario 2"
    [jmx]="test_scenario_name2.jmx"
    [use_backend]=true
    [skip]=false
)
```

Then define following functions in the script.
1. `initialize`
2. `before_execute_test_scenario`
3. `after_execute_test_scenario`

In above functions, following variables may be used
1. `scenario_name`
2. `heap`
3. `users`
4. `msize`
5. `sleep_time`
6. `report_location`

Use `jmeter_params` array in `before_execute_test_scenario` to provide JMeter parameters.

In before_execute_test_scenario `JMETER_JVM_ARGS` variable can be set to provide
additional JVM arguments to JMeter.

Finally, execute test scenarios using the function `test_scenarios`.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jmeter/perf-test-common.sh -h

Usage: 
./jmeter/perf-test-common.sh -m <heap_sizes> -u <concurrent_users> -b <message_sizes> -s <sleep_times> [-d <test_duration>] [-w <warmup_time>]
   [-n <jmeter_servers>] [-j <jmeter_server_heap_size>] [-k <jmeter_client_heap_size>] [-l <netty_service_heap_size>]
   [-i <include_scenario_name>] [-e <include_scenario_name>] [-t] [-p <estimated_processing_time_in_between_tests>] [-h]

-m: Application heap memory sizes. You can give multiple options to specify multiple heap memory sizes. Allowed suffixes: M, G.
-u: Concurrent Users to test. You can give multiple options to specify multiple users.
-b: Message sizes in bytes. You can give multiple options to specify multiple message sizes.

-l: Heap Size of Netty Service. Allowed suffixes: M, G. Default 4G.
-i: Scenario name to to be included. You can give multiple options to filter scenarios.
-e: Scenario name to to be excluded. You can give multiple options to filter scenarios.
-t: Estimate time without executing tests.
-p: Estimated processing time in between tests in seconds. Default 60.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

#### Creating a summary

Use `create-summary-csv.sh` to create a summary CSV file.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jmeter/create-summary-csv.sh -h

Usage: 
./jmeter/create-summary-csv.sh -n <application_name> [-c <column_header_name>] [-r <regex>] [-x] 
   [-p <file_prefix>] [-g <gcviewer_jar_path>] [-d <results_dir>]
   [-j <jmeter_servers>] [-k <application_instance_count>] [-w] [-i] [-l] [-h]

-n: Name of the application to be used in column headers.
-c: Column header name for each parameter.
    You should give multiple header names in order for each directory in the results directory structure.
    Default: Heap Size,Concurrent Users,Message Size (Bytes),Back-end Service Delay (ms)
-r: Regular expression with a single group to extract parameter value from directory name.
    You should give multiple regular expressions in order for each directory in the results directory structure.
    Default: ([0-9]+[a-zA-Z])_heap,([0-9]+)_users,([0-9]+)B,([0-9]+)ms_sleep
-x: Print column names and exit.
-p: Prefix of the files to get metrics (Load Average, GC, etc).
-g: Path of GCViewer Jar file, which will be used to analyze GC logs.
-d: Results directory. Default ./jmeter/results.

-w: Use warmup results instead of measurement results.
-i: Include GC statistics and load averages for other servers.
-l: Exclude Netty Back-end Service statistics. Works with -i.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

Use `csv-to-markdown-converter.py` to convert CSV results into Markdown format.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jmeter/csv-to-markdown-converter.py

Usage: {Input File(.csv)} {Output File (.md)}
```

Use `create-summary-markdown.py` to create a markdown file, which will be a summary of performance test results. This scripts
looks for a `Jinja2` template with the name `summary.md` in `templates` directory.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jmeter/create-summary-markdown.py -h
usage: create-summary-markdown.py [-h] --json-files JSON_FILES
                                  [JSON_FILES ...] --column-names COLUMN_NAMES
                                  [COLUMN_NAMES ...]

Create summary report

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --json-files JSON_FILES [JSON_FILES ...]
                        JSON files with parameters.
  --column-names COLUMN_NAMES [COLUMN_NAMES ...]
                        Columns to include in the report.
```

### JTL Splitter

The "jtl-splitter" directory has a Java program to split a single JTL file into warmup and measurement based on the 
 number of minutes given as the warmup time.

When reporting the results for the performance tests, some specified number of minutes from the beginning of the test 
 are considered as the "Java Warm-up Time" and the from the final results, the warm-up duration is excluded. 
 By doing this, the results reported from the test will only consider the steady-state of the server.

This program should be invoked by the performance testing script after completing the JMeter performance test.

For example if you specify 5 minutes warmup-time, the JTL splitter splits the `results.jtl` file and the `results-warmup.jtl`
file will have the test results for first 5 minutes. The results after 5 minutes will be in `results-measurement.jtl`.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jtl-splitter/jtl-splitter.sh -h

Usage: 
./jtl-splitter/jtl-splitter.sh [-m <heap_size>] [-h] -- [jtl_splitter_flags]

-m: The heap memory size. Default: 1g
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

JTL Splitter usage:

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./jtl-splitter/jtl-splitter.sh -- -h
Usage: JTLSplitter [options]
  Options:
    -d, --delete-jtl-file-on-exit
      Delete JTL File on exit
      Default: false
    -h, --help
      Display Help
  * -f, --jtlfile
      JTL File
    -n, --precision
      Precision to use in statistics
      Default: 2
    -p, --progress

  * -t, --warmup-time
      Warmup Time
      Default: 0
```


### Netty Service

The "netty-service" directory has a simple Netty HTTP Echo Service, which will echo back the body data in the HTTP 
 request.

The Netty HTTP Echo Service should be started by the performance testing script.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./netty-service/netty-start.sh -h

Usage: 
./netty-service/netty-start.sh [-m <heap_size>] [-h] -- [netty_service_flags]

-m: The heap memory size of Netty Service. Default: 4g
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

The script also accepts an argument to specify the number of milliseconds to sleep before sending response. This is
 useful to test the performance with delays.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./netty-service/netty-start.sh -- -h
Starting Netty
Usage: EchoHttpServer [options]
  Options:
    --boss-threads
      Boss Threads
      Default: 4
    --delay

    --ssl
      Enable SSL
      Default: false
    --worker-threads
      Worker Threads
      Default: 8
```

### Payloads

The "payloads" directory has a Java program to generate JSON payloads with different sizes.

By default, the script generates 50B, 1KiB, 10KiB, and 100KiB JSON files.

If you want to generate different payload sizes, pass the payload sizes as parameters.

The performance testing script can call this script to generate payloads required for the performance test.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ ./payloads/generate-payloads.sh -h

Usage: 
./payloads/generate-payloads.sh [-p <payload_type>] [-s <payload_size>]

-p: The Payload Type.
-s: The Payload Size. You can give multiple payload sizes.
-h: Display this help and exit.
```

### SAR

The "sar" directory has a simple script to install System Activity Report (SAR) in Linux and configure it to run every
 one minute.

The script needs to be run as root.

```console
ubuntu@server:~$ sudo ./sar/install-sar.sh -h

Usage: 
./sar/install-sar.sh [-h]

-h: Display this help and exit.
```

### Setup scripts

The "setup" directory has the scripts to setup instances (for example, JMeter Client, JMeter Server, Netty Server, etc.)
